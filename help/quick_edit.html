<p>Quick edit lets you work on a node's body using an external editor.  When you have this setting enabled for a given node, the contents of the node body will be read from the file, rather than the database.  This means that you don't have to keep saving the node, viewing the node and so forth to see how your tweaks are going.  This is meant to be an aid during the migration of pages only, and not for ongoing maintenance.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Anytime you save a node, which has Source to Node enabled on it, a <em>quick edit file</em> will also be saved with the contents of the enabled fields to <code>public://source2node/[nid]/[field_name]</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Anytime the node is loaded, the content of the Body Insert Field will be injected with the content of the <em>quick edit file</em>, rather than the database.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to use it</h2>

<ol>
<li>Load the file in an external browser; see the node edit form for the exact path.</li>
<li>Point your browser to the node view page and make edits to the file using the external editor.</li>
<li>Save the file in your editor and refresh the page, you will see the changes to the node without having to edit the node.</li>
<li>Repeat as needed.</li>
<li>When you're satisfied, you just need to enter the edit mode of the node and click save; whatever is in the file will be captured to the node when it's saved.</li>
</ol>
